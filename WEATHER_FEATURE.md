- `@/lib/utils`: cn utility for className composition

## 🎯 User Experience Features

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly labels
- High contrast weather information

### Performance
- Data caching with 5-minute refresh
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Lazy loading for large datasets

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Horizontal scrolling for hourly forecast
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

## 🚀 Usage

### Navigation
1. Click on the **Weather** tab in the sidebar (CloudSun icon)
2. The page loads at `/apps` route
3. Weather data fetches automatically

### Interacting with Forecast
1. Scroll through the hourly timeline
2. Click any hour to see detailed information
3. Details appear below the timeline

### Manual Refresh
If data fails to load, click "Try again" in the error alert

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend URL
Default: `http://localhost:8080`

To change the backend URL, modify the constant:
```typescript
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'
```

### Auto-Refresh Interval
Default: 300000ms (5 minutes)

To change the refresh interval:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(fetchWeatherData, 300000)
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Weather Conditions
1. Add icon mapping in `weatherIcons`
2. Add background gradient in `weatherBackgrounds`
3. Add suggestions in `weatherSuggestions`

Example:
```typescript
const weatherIcons = {
  // ...existing
  fog: CloudFog,
}

const weatherBackgrounds = {
  // ...existing
  fog: 'bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-300 via-gray-200 to-white',
}

const weatherSuggestions = {
  // ...existing
  fog: ['🌫️ Reduced visibility - drive carefully'],
}
```

### Styling the Hero Section
Modify the `weatherBackgrounds` object to change gradient colors:
```typescript
clear: 'bg-gradient-to-br from-[color1] via-[color2] to-[color3]'
```

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Component Mounts** → `useEffect` triggers
2. **Fetch Weather Data** → API call to backend
3. **Loading State** → Skeleton loaders shown
4. **Data Received** → State updated, UI renders
5. **Auto Refresh** → Every 5 minutes
6. **User Interaction** → Hourly forecast scrubbing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Weather not loading
1. Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:8080/health`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify CORS is enabled on backend
4. Check network tab for API response

### Animations not working
1. Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Check if `animate-pulse` is enabled in Tailwind config
3. Verify browser supports CSS transitions

### Icons not displaying
1. Verify `lucide-react` is installed
2. Check icon imports at top of file
3. Ensure icon names match in `weatherIcons` object

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. **Start the backend**: 
   ```bash
   cd backend/weather
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to Weather page**:
   - Click Weather tab in sidebar
   - Or go to `http://localhost:5173/apps`

4. **Test the features**:

## 📝 Notes

- The Weather page reuses the `/apps` route for now
- The component is still named `Apps` for backwards compatibility
- To rename the route, update `sidebar-data.ts` to point to `/weather`
- All unused Apps-related code has been removed
- The page automatically handles day/night weather conditions
- Weather conditions are case-insensitive
